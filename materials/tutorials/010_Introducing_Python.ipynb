    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern, object-orientated, high-level programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Easy-to-learn**: simple syntax and intuitive code\n",
    "* **Expressive**: can do a lot with a few lines of code\n",
    "* **Interpreted**: no need to compile\n",
    "* **Dynamically typed**: no need to define the types of variables\n",
    "* **Memory managed**: no c-style 'memory leak' bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using Python in COM6018?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is **widely used** in the scientific computing community\n",
    "* Extensive ecosystem of rapidly maturing **libraries**\n",
    "* **Good performance** - closely integrated with time-tested C and Fortran code\n",
    "  * blas, atlas, lapack etc\n",
    "* No license costs (i.e., **free**!) and easy to install\n",
    "* It's a **useful** language to know, i.e. useful outside of COM2004\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Running Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to run Python code including running scripts from the command line, using **Jupyter notebooks** (which we will be using in the labs), or working interactively in a Python shell (e.g. `ipython`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Using the iPython interactive shell\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading these notes at a computer then the easiest way to try out the examples is to cut and paste them into a Python shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a Python shell, open a terminal and type `python` or `ipython` (if installed)."

    "### 2.3 Loading Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a Python program you rarely start from scratch. Instead you build on **library code** that others have already written. This code is organised into **modules**. Many of these modules come with the language and are part of the so-called **Python Standard Library**. Other modules are available from third-parties and can be installed using the `pip` package manager. In this course we will be using some very popular third-party modules which are industry-standard for data science,  including `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using code from a module, the module first needs to be imported. Once a module is imported it will define a **namespace** which contains all the module's functions and variables. To access these functions and variables you need to prefix them with the name of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `sqrt` (square-root) function is defined in the `math` module which\n",
    "is part of the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we use the keyword `import` to import the `math` module. We can then access the `sqrt` function using the syntax `math.sqrt`. We then use the Python builtin `print` function to print some result to the screen."
